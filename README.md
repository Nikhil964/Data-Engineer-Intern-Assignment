# Data-Engineer-Intern-Assignment
A Jupyter notebook to scrape [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population) webpage using Python to create a dataset.

The complete project is detailed as a two parts:

Part 1: How to web scrape the data found in that site and also additional data found in each city website.
  * After running this we will get a Dataset.csv file. We need to upload this in part 2

Part 2: Cleaning the collected data and storing it in csv formatt.
  * Load the Dataset.csv file generated in part 1 for running this.

The final output of part 2 is a csv file (finalDataset.csv) that is ready to be uploaded to a BigQuery table.
